    <td><h1>Non-Pull Dog Harness</h1>
        This Company of Animals Non-Pull Dog harness puts a stop to your dog pulling during walks. and allows you to enjoy relaxed walks with your dog by your side. Soft nylon straps and an elastic mesh chest panel give the dog a high level of comfort and good freedom of movement, whilst still allowing the owner to remain in control.The soft Sherpa Sleeves on the chest straps make the harness extra comfortable: They don't cut in or catch on skin or hair, even if the dog pulls hard against them. The straps meet at the chest, running under the front legs and meeting again at the back. The practical sliding security cord lock that tightens the straps from the back allows the harness to be adjusted precisely to fit your dog. If your dog pulls on the lead, the harness tightens around it, which allows you to maintain control and ultimately gently deters the dog from pulling and to return to normal controlled walking. </td>

    <td><h1>Swing with Lime Perch</h1>
      Swings make your bird feel like it is perched on a swaying branch in the wind giving some movement within its cage. Therefore, it is important that the swing is large enough and it meets the requirements of your feathered friend.
The sisal swing is special due to its top quality, lime perch. This can help your bird to keep their beak and claws sharp and short, like they would in the wild. The bird's feet muscles will also be kept in better shape, helping to avoid pressure sores.
